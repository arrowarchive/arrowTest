    <h2>CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</h2>
    
    <p><b>UPDATE:</b> As of September 20th, 2022, the overlay issue has been resolved. I am in the process of adding all the images back in with their respective overlays, and that will take some time. I'm not sure if I will have all the entries done by the next milestone. My goal is to make all the 2022 images have their entries (unless they have multiple pictures), but solo images from before that time will link to the template file I have in each folder, if they are linked to it at all. I also have to read into text scaling, which Joey linked an article to me about. It would be weird to have <i>just</i> the images scale and not the rest of the text.</p>
