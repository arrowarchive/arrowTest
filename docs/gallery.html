    <h1>Gallery</h1>
    
    <h2>CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</h2>
    
    <p>Normally this page would have pictures up the wazoo, but currently, it is not in a state where they can appear. I'm analyzing the code of other websites so I can restructure my gallery css, but I'm also planning on making a specific layout for it.</p>
    <p>In the layout I have in mind, I'm considering using multiple includes names after the year the artwork I made was published in. My only concern is that the amount of includes I use will accumulate and some other ideas I have (see latest) won't work because of it.</p>
    <p>I may make an include with the few pieces I've made this year, but it will mostly serve to test the css I'm tinkering with from my references.</p>
