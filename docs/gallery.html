    <h1>Gallery</h1>
    
    <h2>CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</h2>
    
    <p>Normally this page would have pictures up the wazoo, but currently, it is not in a state where they can appear. I'm analyzing the code of other websites so I can restructure my gallery css, but I'm also planning on making a specific layout for it.</p>
    <p>In the layout I have in mind, I'm considering using multiple includes names after the year the artwork I made was published in. My only concern is that the amount of includes I use will accumulate and some other ideas I have (see latest) won't work because of it.</p>
    <p>I may make an include with the few pieces I've made this year, but it will mostly serve to test the css I'm tinkering with from my references.</p>
    
    <p><b>UPDATE:</b> As of September 15th, 2022, I am temporarily using includes for the years on the archive. I included the pieces I made during 2022 and I am planning to add in structured overlays with dates on them, but for some reason, the images are placed over the overlays. I don't know how to resolve this bug. If someone could look over my code and see what the cause of the issue is, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>
    <p>Mia's code for the art show was really helpful for starting the reconstruction of the gallery page. I just hope it provides enough to support the rest of the gallery.</p>
