    <h1>Redirect Test</h1>
    
    <p>This page is a placeholder for my gallery redirects until their layouts are finished.</p> 
    
    <p>Several blogs on the archive include more than one image, and I have mapped out a layout design for users to scroll through them using arrows rather than scroll down to view all the pictures. This will take some time to design, so if gallery links redirect here, it is because their layout is in development until further notice. Part of this maintenance includes configuring file paths for includes, which is why the page is missing its CSS components and the code used for the sidebar isn't functioning properly. The sidebar on this page will only give you an error message at the moment. I'm working to resolve that.</p>
    
    <p>I apologize for the inconvenience, but that's the way it is when you're coding your portfolio from scratch. Thank you for understanding!</p>
