                <p>Earlier this year, I did a pose study and used some models from the <i>Danganronpa</i> series as a reference. The characters are very expressive and they are good for practicing anatomy.</p>
                
                <p>I chose Shadow and Electra for this study, and I used sprites from Akane Owari in <i>Danganronpa: Goodbye Despair</i> and Kokichi Oma in <i>Danganronpa V3</i> as references.</p>
                
                <p>The expressions suited their characters, and I got a better grasp on the hands from this exercise. As a bonus, this was my first full-body drawing of Electra’s redesign, and I’m really happy with how it turned out! I’ve used that design ever since, plus or minus the goggles on his head.</p>
                
                <p>The sprites I used for this study can be found <a href="https://danganronpa.fandom.com/wiki/Akane_Owari/Sprite_Gallery?file=Akane_Owari_Halfbody_Sprite_%25288%2529.png"><b>here</b></a> and <a href="https://danganronpa.fandom.com/wiki/Kokichi_Oma/Sprite_Gallery?file=Danganronpa_V3_Kokichi_Oma_Fullbody_Sprite_%25288%2529.png"><b>here.</b></a></p>
                
               <p>If I post another study like this, I will cite the references I used similar to how I did here. I attribute partial credit to <i>The Danganronpa Wiki</i> for archiving the sprites I used and <i>Spike Chunsoft</i> for publishing the games in which they came from.</p>
