    <h1>"Latest Works"</h1>
    
    <!-- I've added an image with the ideas I have in mind. The only artwork I've imported are the assets I use for the main pages. I don't have enough for gallery entries, and I'm considering making a new layout specifically for the latest works and gallery pages. Hopefully someone will read this, because I appreciate all the help I can get. I also would like to add dropdowns to the Frequently Asked Questions, but that's a job for another day. -RGG -->

    <p> I'm putting the title of this page in air quotes because I want to add more to this and possibly restructure it. I have an idea in mind for how I want the layout to work and I mapped out concepts for how I hope they will look. My concerns are whether or not they are reasonable goals that are achievable/can be achieved during this class with the knowledge I possess and with the material we are covering.</p>
    
    <p>The idea I have is to use some kind of code to run through the images in the gallery, pick out the top ten most recent, and have them autoplay in a slideshow-style format where the images can be clicked to go to their respective entry. I don't know which it is and if it is even possible if I use includes for the years in which I've made digital art, but I have hope that it can go somewhere. The current look of my layout page could be a LOT more accessible than it is now.</p>
